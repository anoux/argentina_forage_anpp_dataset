Estimation of Annual Forage Productivity in Argentine grasslands 

This project aimed to compile, analyze, and estimate the annual forage productivity across diverse vegetation types, focusing on distinguishing between spontaneous and cultivated vegetation.

Outcomes:

- Spatially and temporally explicit database of ANPP records detailing the annual forage productivity of both spontaneous and cultivated vegetation, as well as other key information (such as precipitation, fertilzation, species richness and variability sources.

- Estimation of spatial and temporal variations in forage productivity through statistical analysis techniques and identification of factors influencing productivity.

- Map that illustrates the distribution of ANPP records and areas lacking data, which provides valuable insights for future research and resource management.
