# Estimation of Annual Forage Productivity in Argentine grasslands 

### This project aimed to compile, analyze, and estimate the annual forage productivity in terms of ANPP (annual net primary production) across diverse vegetation types, focusing on distinguishing between spontaneous and cultivated vegetation for almost 40 years period.

## Outcomes:

- Spatially and temporally explicit database of ANPP records detailing the annual forage productivity of both spontaneous and cultivated vegetation, as well as other key information (such as precipitation, fertilzation, species richness and variability sources.

- Estimation of spatial and temporal variations in forage productivity through statistical analysis techniques and identification of factors influencing productivity.

- Map that illustrates the distribution of ANPP records and areas lacking data, which provides valuable insights for future research and resource management.

## Regarding to this [First visualization](anpp_dataset_visualization.pdf) 

-  The mean annual precipitation (MAP) is greater in the Pampa, Espinal, and Chaco regions compared to the Monte and Patagonia regions.
  
- Consistently with MAP, ANPP is greater in the Pampa and Espinal regions than in the Monte and Patagonia regions except for Chaco region, where it is lower even thouhg its MAP is not. This could be explained by another condition, like soil type or seasonality precipitation.

- he map shows larger and more frequent bubbles in northern Argentina, indicating that most records come from the north rather than the south.
